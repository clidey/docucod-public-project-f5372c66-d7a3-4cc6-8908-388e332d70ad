# Installation

Step-by-step directions for installing Open Deep Research on Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms. This guide covers cloning the repository, managing Python virtual environments, and installing all necessary dependencies to ensure a reproducible and reliable setup.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu/Debian preferred), macOS (10.15+), or Windows 10/11
- **Python Version**: Python 3.11 (ensure compatibility)
- **Disk Space**: At least 500 MB free to accommodate the repository and dependencies
- **Memory**: Minimum 8 GB RAM recommended for smooth operation
- **Network**: External internet access for cloning, package installation, and web API calls

---

## 2. Clone the Repository

Open a terminal or command prompt and execute the following:

```bash
# Clone the official repository
git clone https://github.com/langchain-ai/open_deep_research.git

# Enter the project directory
cd open_deep_research
```

> This step downloads the entire source code and example notebooks for Open Deep Research.

---

## 3. Set Up a Python Virtual Environment

Using a virtual environment ensures dependency isolation and avoids conflicts.

### macOS / Linux

If `python3` is installed:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment named .venv
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

<Note>
If you encounter a security error running the activation script on Windows, you may need to set execution policy temporarily:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```
</Note>

---

## 4. Install Dependencies

Inside the activated virtual environment, install all required Python packages:

```bash
# Install all dependencies using pip and the provided pyproject.toml
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
```

> This step installs core libraries including `langchain`, `langgraph`, and dependencies for MCP integration and supported search APIs.

---

## 5. Configure Environment Variables

Duplicate the example environment file to `.env` and customize keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` in a text editor and fill in your API keys, such as:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `TAVILY_API_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

<Warning>
All API keys are essential for enabling model providers and search tool integrations. Missing keys will limit functionality.
</Warning>

---

## 6. Verify Python Environment Setup

Confirm Python version and dependencies:

```bash
python --version
# Expected output: Python 3.11.x

pip list | grep langchain
# Should list installed packages including langchain and open_deep_research
```

Verify API key environment variables:

- On macOS/Linux:

```bash
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
```

- On Windows Command Prompt:

```cmd
echo %OPENAI_API_KEY%
```

---

## 7. Start the LangGraph Server

Run the LangGraph server to launch the Open Deep Research assistant:

### macOS / Linux

```bash
# Install uv package manager if not installed
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Start the LangGraph server
uvx --refresh --from "langgraph-cli[inmem]" --with-editable . --python 3.11 langgraph dev --allow-blocking
```

### Windows / Linux Alternative

```powershell
pip install -e .
pip install -U "langgraph-cli[inmem]"
langgraph dev
```

---

## 8. Access the Studio UI

Open your web browser and navigate to:

```
- API Endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:2024
- Studio UI: https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024
- API Documentation: http://127.0.0.1:2024/docs
```

This UI provides the interface for managing conversations, research tasks, and report generation.

---

## 9. Testing the Installation

### Run Example Notebooks

The repository includes example notebooks demonstrating research workflows.

Open Jupyter and load the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook src/legacy/multi_agent.ipynb
```

Follow documented cells to run multi-agent or graph workflow research.

### Run CLI Tests

You can run automated tests for the multi-agent or graph implementations:

```bash
# Test multi-agent implementation only
python tests/run_test.py --agent multi_agent

# Test graph-based implementation only
python tests/run_test.py --agent graph
```

These tests check report generation quality and help verify installation integrity.

## 10. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Issues and Fixes">
<Accordion title="Virtual Environment Activation Fails on Windows">
You may encounter a PowerShell security error. Run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

Then retry virtual environment activation.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing API Keys or Environment Variables">
Ensure your `.env` file exists with the correct keys, and the environment variables are loaded. Restart the shell if necessary.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Dependency Installation Errors">
Check your Python version (must be 3.11). Upgrade pip:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

If packages fail to build, verify system compilers and libraries.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="LangGraph Server Fails to Start">
Confirm network ports (default 2024) are free and dependencies installed. Use verbose logging for error clues.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 11. Next Steps

- Proceed to **Configuration Setup** to customize model providers, search APIs, and MCP details.
- Explore **Launching the Agent** to interact with and test your research queries.
- Review **Using MCP Servers** if you want to extend research capabilities with local or remote data sources.
- Consult the **Troubleshooting and Performance Tips** if issues arise during use.
