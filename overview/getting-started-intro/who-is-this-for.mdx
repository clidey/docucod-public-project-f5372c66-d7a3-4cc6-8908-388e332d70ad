# Who Should Use This? (Target Audience & Use Cases)

Open Deep Research is designed to empower **both technical and non-technical users** who seek to automate deep research, comparative analysis, and knowledge synthesis. Whether you are an analyst racing against deadlines, a developer integrating research agents into a larger platform, or an organization looking to democratize complex research, this product provides powerful tools and workflows to accelerate your insights and decision-making.

---

## Intended Users

- **Analysts and Researchers** who want to speed up the research lifecycle by automating information gathering, synthesis, and report generation without sacrificing depth or quality.
- **Developers and AI Builders** looking to embed advanced multi-agent research capabilities into their applications or platforms, leveraging flexible integration with search APIs and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.
- **Non-technical Stakeholders** (e.g., business users, product managers, executives) who want to leverage AI-driven research assistants to gain insights directly, without needing to manually comb through data or learn complex tools.
- **Teams and Organizations** aiming to democratize access to sophisticated research workflows and tools, enabling broader knowledge sharing and reducing bottlenecks.

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Analyst Workflow Acceleration

Turn time-consuming, manual research into an automated, parallelized process. Analysts can:
- Input a topic or question and receive comprehensive, well-structured reports with citations.
- Use multi-agent parallelism to handle multiple aspects of a topic simultaneously, cutting research time dramatically.
- Integrate multiple search APIs or MCP servers to access specialized data sources.

### 2. Agent Platform Integration

Developers embedding Open Deep Research into their AI agent platforms can:
- Leverage the supervisor-researcher multi-agent architecture for scalable, concurrent research tasks.
- Utilize MCP integration to connect with various data sources (local filesystems, databases, APIs) via lightweight servers.
- Customize model selections, prompts, and tools to fit niche application needs or enterprise compliance.

### 3. Research Democratization

Organizations can enable broader access to advanced research assistants by:
- Deploying the system on internal platforms or Open Agent Platform (OAP) with simple API key provisioning.
- Allowing non-technical teams to generate deep-dive reports with minimal setup.
- Reducing dependency on specialized personnel for complex information gathering.

## Why It Matters

Without automation, deep research is often slow, inconsistent, and requires high expertise. Open Deep Research:

- Provides **speed without compromising accuracy**, thanks to parallelized agent workflows and iterative reflection.
- Bridges the **gap between AI and real-world data** with built-in support for cutting-edge search tools and MCP servers.
- Supports **flexible customization**, making it suitable for a wide range of domains and user expertise levels.

## Practical Tips for Users

- If you are an analyst, start by defining clear, focused research questions to guide the automated agents effectively.
- For developers, ensure model selection and tool configuration are tailored to your data sources and use cases, maximizing the agent’s effectiveness.
- Non-technical users should leverage pre-configured deployments on platforms like Open Agent Platform and provide simple topic prompts to get started.
- Teams should adopt workflows that include iterative clarification and feedback capabilities when deep precision is needed.
